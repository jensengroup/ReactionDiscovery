# ReactionDiscovery

Tools to search 1-step reactions for reactant systems
This includes searching for potential products, estimating their barriers using RMSD-PP and finally refining the transition states at either xTB or DFT level of theory

## Product search

* Procedure for systematic product search is found in ```systematic search```
* Procedure for meta-dynamics product search is found in ```metadyn_product_search``` along with description of usage

## RMSD-PP barrier estimated
* Procedure for the RMSD-PP barrier estimates are found in ```rmsd_pp``` 


## TS refinement
* For xTB TS refinement: ```xtb_ts_test```
* for DFT TS refinement: ```dft_ts_test```
